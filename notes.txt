Components and Directives have Lifecycle Hooks
Components have more Lifecycle Hooks than Directives

Lifecycle Hooks for both Components & Directives:
ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngDoCheck, ngDestroy

Lifecycle Hooks for Components (only):
ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked

Summary:
ngOnInit => Once component is loaded into the DOM, that component's constructor and ngOnInit method will be called
ngOnDestroy => will be called once just BEFORE the component is removed from the DOM, in other words when the component is destroyed from the DOM
ngOnChanges => will be called once before OnInit and will be called whenever the data-bound input properties changes.
ngDoCheck => will be invoked when the change detector of the given component invoked

ngAfterContentInit => will be called ONLY once after the first DoCheck
ngAfterContentChecked => will be called after AfterContentInit
ngAfterViewInit => will be called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked
ngAfterViewChecked => will be called once after ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked
